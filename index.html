Both stood for courage, speed, and extraordinary technology. No wonder Ettore Bugatti became as fascinated by aviation and pilots as he was by motor cars. And no wonder the most courageous pilots of the time were fascinated by BUGATTI’s agile, light, and speedy vehicles, embodying on the road what their planes were in the sky.With the exclusive edition “Les Légendes du Ciel”, BUGATTI pays homage to the unique and fruitful relationship between our founder and France’s legendary pilots and race car drivers Louis Blériot, Roland Garros, Robert Benoist, Bartolomeo Costantini, and Albert Divo.AN HOMAGE TO FRANCE’S DAREDEVILS OF THE SKYThe model is based on a CHIRON Sport in matt grey (“Gris Serpent”), mirroring the metallic exterior colour of the early 20th century planes. A broad high-contrast, white gloss runway-like center stripe spans over the car’s complete body from the back to the front. The double wing front is a reminiscence of the Nieuport 17 biplane flown by so many of those pilots. And the horseshoe radiator grille’s mesh pattern resembles planes flying in parade formation. The logo (a propeller) and lettering “Les Légendes du Ciel” are applied to the left and right front fenders. The Bleu-Blanc-Rouge French tricolor decorates the car’s exposed-carbon-fiber side sills, paying tribute to BUGATTI’s and the Daredevils’ origins. Customers who want to add a further touch of sky to their Légendes du Ciel, can select a Sky View glass roof.</p>
